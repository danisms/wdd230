            <h2>Alma 7:10-13</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>10</strong> And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at bJerusalem which 
                is the land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious 
                and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceive by 
                the power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even 
                the Son of God.

                <strong>11</strong> And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and 
                temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith 
                he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.<br><br>

                <strong>12</strong> And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands 
                of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, 
                that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know 
                according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.<br><br>
                
                <strong>13</strong> Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God 
                suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, 
                that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; 
                and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me.

            <h2>Heleman 5:12</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>12</strong> And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, 
                who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the 
                devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when 
                all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you 
                to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which 
                ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.
